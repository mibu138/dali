It would be cool to, in addition to painting through images on the screen, paint through images using surfaces with 0 gaussian curvature.
So like cylindrical geometry. This would be useful for painting onto beams and such, or even faces. Zero gaussian curvature would allow
for distortion free images, though perhaps any aribitrary shape could be used (2nd or 3rd input). So a pre-textured peice of geometry
gets passed in to provide not only the image to paint through but also the "carrier" of the paint.

Want to see if push constants can be set entirely in the draw function.
So I can remove them as static globals.

Features from substance painter to add:
    Triplanar projection.
    Substance like brush?
    Bake maps? Curvature, position, etc.
